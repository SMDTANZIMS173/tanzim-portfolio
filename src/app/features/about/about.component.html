        <h3>Professional Journey</h3>
        <p>
          Currently working at Mphasis, contributing to real-world banking applications involving Web APIs, backend systems, and AI-assisted solutions.
          My core expertise is in ASP.NET Core MVC for backend development and Angular for frontend development.
          I also work with Machine Learning for pattern recognition and identifying hidden trends in use cases such as Home Loan processing, where AI supports decision-making while maintaining a human-in-the-loop for final validation.
          This helps reduce manual effort and supports the development of fair and efficient systems.
